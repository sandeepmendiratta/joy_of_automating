4. The tools and skills we will use to solve the problem
5. Talk about the scenario
6. Transition to getting started

### Example: Introduction

Welcome to the Joy of Automating. I'm Franklin Webber. In this episode we are going to focus on working with legacy code. This is a Chef cookbook that deploys Redis on Ubuntu. We will write unit tests and integration tests to capture the current state. And then refactor the recipe and perhaps even the tests we wrote.

Legacy code is everywhere. Learning the steps to tackle this kind of work essential.

Let's get started.

## Ending

### Format

1. Restate the scenario
2. Express how the tools solved the problem
3. State why the scenario is important
4. State any wisdom about the challenges ahead

### Example: Ending

In this episode we were presented with legacy code that we were able to understand and improve with testing and refactoring.

But remember, the skills you learned here should be applied judicially to the code impacting your velocity. Otherwise you're practicing in production.

Thank you for joining me. Happy Automating.
